Rv.7.4:
* [SECURITY] WARNING: Bug found due to the insert_location() function (download system) which reveals premium cookies and base_64 encoded auth-strings to end user(s). The premium accounts of rapidleech servers providing premium-account downloads to public, are in danger of having their premium accounts compromised! Private rapidleech servers are safe for now, but are strongly encouraged to upgrade - Szalinski, Th3-882
* [SECURITY] New premium cookie encryption system implemented (due to the complexity of cookie system and to keep load on 3rd-party servers to a minimum, cookies are encrypted instead, and then decrypted when needed) - Szalinski, Th3-882
* [SECURITY] New $secretkey in config.php,which is used for cookie encryption. A standard key is included, but you must create your own random string, max 56 characters in length, customized to be user friendly in xpanel - Szalinski, viant77
